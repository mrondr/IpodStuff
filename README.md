# Ipod Stuff

A collection of random useful things for Ipod modding.

In case you end up here before you see [opista's website](https://opista.com/posts/ipod-classic-modding-guide) and [Olsro's repo](https://github.com/Olsro/reddit-ipod-guides), make sure to check them out. They are goldmines of infos.

## CF adapter instructions

With the ipod connected to the computer with it's usb cable:
1. Deleted all partitions with AOMEI Partition manager.
2. Rebuilt MBR with AOMEI.
3. Created a Partition as Fat32, with "SSD" Checked, and Optimized.
4. Rebuilt MBR with AOMEI.
5. Started restore in Itunes.
6. While Restoring, I went back to AOMEI and set up the MBR Rebuild with 1 button left to confirm actual start.
7. As soon as Itunes restore stopped, I started the MBR Rebuild.
8. Got the "Plug into wall charger: Icon ON the iPOD !
9. Plugged into Wall Charger (the one with the firewire type cable)
10. Immediately saw the iPod screen showing a restore progress.
11. Connect to itu es and sync your music.

I succeded in this on a 5th gen but not on a 6th gen, same adapter. Apparently that's common, at least according to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1lrol77/comment/n1eh68k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

I never succeded in this. But I only tried with the infamous red CF adapter on the 6th gen, which apparently is a doomed combination.

### Firmware upgrade for 6th gen

## 5th to 7th gen body compatibility

## 5th - 7th screen compatibility

The two ribbon cable are similar but slightly different, with,the 7th gen one being wider. 
You can use a 5th gen screen in a 7th gen but this will result in weird colors.
